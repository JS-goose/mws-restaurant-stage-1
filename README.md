# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 5
---
This app was built as part of the FEND program.  This is a map of select eateries in and around the New York area.

Here is the [live version of the app](https://js-goose.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/)

Below are some images of the app in action.

This app was built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* LeafletJS (see below)
* Mapbox (see below)

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is a free to use map service much like Google Maps. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
